# WORKING WITH TUPLE

- Like lists, tuples are data structures that can contain multiple items.

Syntax:
```
mytuple = (item1, item2, item3, ...)
```

### Accessing items in a tuple
mytuple[index]

- Unlike lists, tuples are immutable. In other words, after a tuple has been created we can't add, remove, or set items.
- Because tuples are immutable, they are more efficient than lists.
- As a result, we should use a tuple whenever we know the items won't be changed.


### Unpacking a tuple
We can unpack the values of a tuple into multiple variables by using a multiple assignment statement.
