# WORKING WIT DATES AND TIMES
> The `datetime` module contains constructors for constructing date and time objects (values).

- From the `datetime` module, we can use the following constructors to create date, time and datetime objects:
    - date(year, month, day)
    - time(hour, minute, second, microsecond)
    - datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond)
    - timedelta(days, seconds, microseconds)
